🔹 Task 1: Factorial Calculation Using Recursion

This Python program takes an integer input from the user and calculates its factorial using a recursive function. The function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches the base case (0! = 1). This program demonstrates recursion, function definition, and conditional logic in Python.

🔹 Task 2: Mathematical Operations Using math Module

This Python program uses the built-in math module to perform various mathematical operations on a user-provided number. It calculates and displays the square root, natural logarithm, and sine of the given number. The program helps illustrate how to import and use standard Python libraries.
